    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This sausage and rice recipe is a real crowd-pleaser, it's totally delicious and 
        really easy to make. On the table and ready to tuck into, in just under 40 minutes.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>14.79 ml olive oil, for frying</li>
        <li>1 red onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 red pepper, deseeded and chopped (but not too small)</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, very finely sliced</li>
        <li>5 spiced sausages, e.g. Italian chilli</li>
        <li>1 heaped teaspoon smoked paprika (Gordon uses La Chinata brand)</li>
        <li>200g long-grain rice (1 cup)</li>
        <li>1/2 glass dry white wine</li>
        <li>500ml (2 cups) chicken stock - I used a Knorr stockpot</li>
        <li>4 spring onions, trimmed and sliced</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>small bunch of flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add just 1 tbsp of Olive oil to a heavy-based casserole dish and fry the onion for 5 minutes until soft but not coloured.</li>
        <li>Add the pepper and garlic and cook for 2 minutes while moving it about so the garlic doesn't burn.</li>
        <li>Slit the sausage skins and crumble the sausage meat so it looks like small meatballs.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat to high (otherwise, the sausage will steam rather than brown). Cook while moving it about a bit in the pan for about 4–5 minutes until coloured.</li>
        <li>Add the smoked paprika and mix and season to taste.</li>
        <li>Add the rice and stir well to mix thoroughly and absorb the flavour.</li>
        <li>Now deglaze the pan by pouring in the white wine and scraping any bits stuck to the bottom.</li>
        <li>Add the stock and bring to the boil and then turn to simmer.</li>
        <li>Cook gently for 15–20 minutes until the rice is tender and the liquid almost entirely absorbed.</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on it and stir from time to time.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat, gently fold in the spring onions, tomato and parsley and serve.</li>
    </ol>
