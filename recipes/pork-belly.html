    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pork belly is one of the most delicious cuts of meat you can cook with your 
        air fryer. This is because it can be slow cooked in its own fat to create a 
        delicious crispy skin and succulent meat on the inside.
    </p>
    <p>Cooking pork belly doesnâ€™t need to be complicated. You can get perfectly 
        roasted crispy pork belly by simply cooking it in your air fryer. No need 
        to boil it first, no need to pressure cook in an Instant Pot, or dry it out 
        overnight, no poking holes with a stick, no deep frying. No, that is all 
        unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
        This really is the quick and easy crispy pork belly recipe you have been looking for!
        Air frying is a great way to cook pork, especially if you like really crunchy 
        cracking. Try this air fryer pork roast, air fryer pork chops, air fryer pork 
        tenderloin, and air fryer pork steaks.
